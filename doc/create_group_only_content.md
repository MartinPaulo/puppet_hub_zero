Create a Group:
 
Users ->  Access Groups -> New

Give it a title and select the parent group of "Registered"

The new group inherits all the Permissions of the Registered group.

Create an Access Level

Users -> Access Level -> New

Give it a name, and select the group that you previously created to allow them viewing access.

Create a new page:

Content -> Article Manager -> Add New Article 

Change the Access setting to your level. Now only people who belong to the group will be able to read the article.

Then go to:

Users -> User Manager

and click on a user that you want to add to the group. Then scroll down to the bottom and check your new group.

The user will have to log out, and then log in again, but once they have done that, they will be able to see the
article.

You can similarly also create a menu item that is visible to only members of the group when they are logged in.

Not even administrators can view these pages or menu items on the front end!
